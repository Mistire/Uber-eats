          <p class="section9-que">What steps is Uber taking toward sustainability?</p>
          <p class="section9-ans">Uber has many initiatives to improve sustainability metrics, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="section9-ans"><strong>Multimodal delivery</strong>: Couriers have the option to make deliveries by walking or using bikes, scooters, or electric vehicles. Through a variety of partnerships, Uber is making it easier for couriers to access greener vehicles.</p></li>
            <li><p class="section9-ans"><strong>Group orders</strong>: Uber Eats users can place group orders with friends or colleagues to share a courier on an order from the same restaurant. Batching orders improves efficiency and reduces duplicative travel and emissions.  </p></li>
            <li><p class="section9-ans"><strong>Utensil opt-in</strong>: To reduce plastic waste, Uber Eats users must request utensils and straws, as these are no longer automatically included in meal orders.</p></li>
            <li><p class="section9-ans"><strong>Neighborhood pickup</strong>: Uber Eats displays a pickup map with a wide selection of neighborhood restaurants where customers could choose to walk and pick up their orders in person.</p></li>
